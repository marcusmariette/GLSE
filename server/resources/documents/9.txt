Contemporary infrastructure networks require large investments especially due to aging. In-
vestment opportunities of network-of-networks are often obscured because current scenarios
often concern single infrastructure networks. Major barriers to the construction and use of
network-of-networks scenarios are institutional fragmentation and the disconnection of scenario-
development phases. This paper aims to construct and enhance the use of network-of-networks
scenarios through a participatory scenario process. We employed a hybrid-method approach
comprising document analysis, Disaggregative Policy Delphi, and futures-oriented workshop for
five large national infrastructure administrations in the Netherlands. This approach yielded
twelve key infrastructure developments for which 28 infrastructure experts provided future es-
timates. We constructed seven scenarios through cluster analysis of experts’ quantitative esti-
mates, qualitative direct content analysis of the qualitative data, and a futures table. The
scenarios are: Infraconomy; Techno-Pessimism; Safety; Technological; Missed Boat; Hyperloop;
and Green. Our results stress the importance of collaboration: desired scenarios are improbable
when infrastructure administrations maintain their current sectoral perspective, whereas an inter-
sectoral perspective may generate more investment opportunities. However, these network-of-
networks investment opportunities do not simply emerge from network-of-networks scenarios;
reasons include administrators’ prevailing conception that sufficient optimization capacity re-
mains within their own networks, and that no common ground exists that helps to overcome
institutional fragmentation.
1. Introduction
Infrastructure planners in many western countries are increasingly confronted with new challenges. On the one hand, these relate
to aging infrastructures and to increased quantity and quality demands of infrastructures1 such as roads, railways, and sea- and airports

1 More precisely, with infrastructure we broadly refer to “the physical network that channels a flux (...) through conduits (...) or a medium (...)
with the purpose of supporting a human population” (Neuman, 2006, p. 6). In our study, infrastructure concerns the physical conduits, i.e., the
nodes and links of the network, demarcated to utilities (e.g., gas and electricity), public works (also when they are not publicly administered, e.g.,
highways and bridges), and individual physical facilities (e.g., ports and airports) at a national scale (as opposed to component or asset scale). We
focus on transport and energy distribution infrastructures. We do not refer to social infrastructure (e.g., parks, sport facilities, hospitals, etc.) and
knowledge networks (e.g., schools, universities).

2(EIB, 2015; Herder & Wijnia, 2012; Womack, 2008). On the other hand, these relate to increasing interdependencies between systems
generally (Biggs et al., 2015; De Roo & Silva, 2010; Loorbach, 2010) and different infrastructure networks specifically that can cause
malperformance and cascade from one infrastructure network to another (D’Agostino & Scala, 2014; Lee et al., 2007; Rinaldi et al.,
2001; Zimmerman, 2001). Because of the increasing demand for infrastructure services due to, inter alia, economic growth, and so-
cietal requirements such as sustainability and climate adaptation (Anand et al., 2018; Hansman et al., 2006; Schuckmann et al., 2012;
Schwab et al., 2017), aging and interdependent infrastructures increasingly threaten the uninterrupted flows of services – such as
energy provision, transportation of goods and persons, and even human life in the case of, e.g., fatal breakdowns, gas explosions, or
floods (De Bruijne, 2006; Verbong & van der Vleuten, 2004).
Considerable investments are needed to prevent infrastructure failures (EIB, 2015; OECD, 2017). These investments should address
the long lifespan of infrastructures, because infrastructures are characterized by high sunk costs and therefore invoke path de-
pendencies and lock-in; once constructed, infrastructures are not easily abandoned and they become sources of inertia (De Bruijne,
2006; Geels, 2004; Wegener & Fürst, 1999). Additionally, future developments and societal needs are characterized by uncertainty
(Maier et al., 2016; Pot et al., 2018; Rauws, 2017; Rittel and Webber, 1973; Walker et al., 2013), and different developments and needs
may require different infrastructures. Therefore, infrastructure planners should anticipate multiple possible futures (cf. B ̈orjeson et al.,
2006) collectively, given network interdependency effects (cf. Rinaldi et al., 2001).
Usually, however, infrastructure administrators only moderately collaborate in strategic infrastructure planning processes (Van der
Duin & Ligtvoet, 2019a, 2019b). A major barrier for collaboration in infrastructure planning is institutional fragmentation due to
sectoral optimization (Busscher et al., 2015; De Bruijne & Van Eeten, 2007; Heeres et al., 2016; Loorbach et al., 2010). Sectoral
optimization results in sectoral isolation instead of sectoral integration (De Bruijne, 2006; Geels, 2004), making strategic infrastructure
planning processes vulnerable to myopia (Pot et al., 2018). Fragmentation also applies to infrastructure administrators’ strategic
policy and innovation agendas, which are largely determined by government and politics. In turn, “this means that major decisions
may be made on a political spur, while more incremental or maintenance-related decisions require careful readjustment of increasingly
rationalized budgets” (Van der Duin & Ligtvoet, 2019a, p. 72). Whilst sectoral isolation may decrease the perceived complexity of
decision-making processes with the promise of increased efficiency (Teisman et al., 2009), it hampers the collective anticipation of
multiple possible futures. Furthermore, institutional fragmentation may hamper strategic planning processes that address the in-
terdependencies between infrastructure networks, thence obscuring investment opportunities on a network-of-networks level. A
network-of-networks is the combination of multiple networks, where the functionality of one infrastructure network may (positively or
negatively) affect another network, through geographic co-location or functional interdependence of goods or information (Rinaldi
et al., 2001). Importantly, an infrastructure network in a network-of-networks may malfunction – despite having no investment need of
itself – because of disruptions and interconnections of (tightly) coupled networks with direct interconnections. For example, the
disruption of an energy network may inhibit the operation of an airport, which may cause departure halls to overcrowd, for which the
access to the airport may be restricted to prevent panic by closing parts of the highway and railroad networks connecting to the airport.
Therefore, despite institutional fragmentation, infrastructure administrations involved in making investments in infrastructure net-
works should address both this network-of-networks level and multiple possible futures to explore investment opportunities and
improve network functioning.
In this paper, we address the challenges of anticipating multiple possible futures of network-of-networks. We argue that strategic
infrastructure (investment) planning processes require insight in a set of possible futures – i.e., scenarios – that a network-of-networks
is required to accommodate, and that those scenarios should be collectively enacted upon between infrastructure administrators (cf.
Hertogh & Bakker, 2017; Moloney et al., 2017). Whereas recent scenario studies focused on single networks (e.g. Liimatainen et al.,
2014; Linz, 2012; Tapio et al., 2017), scenarios on a network-of-networks level are largely absent (Hall et al., 2013). Furthermore, this
paper provides insight into how the phases of scenario construction and use can be bridged. This is pivotal because the disconnection of
these scenario phases hampers effective anticipation (O’Brien & Meadows, 2013) and because little is known about how to effectively
connect these phases, despite contemporary developments in participatory scenario studies (e.g. Heger and Rohrbeck, 2012; Nygr ́en,
2019; van der Duin et al., 2014).
The aim of this paper is to investigate possible future developments surrounding infrastructure networks by constructing scenarios
for the network-of-networks, and to explore the use of those scenarios for the planning of individual infrastructure networks and the
network-of-networks by infrastructure administrators. The research questions are: (1) what are possible scenarios on a network-of-
networks level and (2) what are the consequences of the constructed scenarios for infrastructure planning? We focused our study
on the Netherlands, because Dutch infrastructure planning is often characterized as institutionally fragmented, and because the
country’s high spatial density of inhabitants and infrastructure networks gives rise to many interdependencies and possibly network-
of-networks investment opportunities.
2. Scenarios as products and processes
Acknowledging the versatility of the concept of scenarios and the discussion about definitions and approaches in the literature
(Bradfield et al., 2005; Spaniol & Rowland, 2018; Vecchiato & Roveda, 2010), scenarios can generally be defined as fundamentally
different futures that are analytically coherent and internally consistent, encompassing concrete and plausible end states, their sur-
roundings, and the wider environments in a concrete and focused narrative (Bishop et al., 2007; Hirschhorn, 1980; Nowack et al.,
2011; Ramirez et al., 2008; Schoemaker, 1993; Wright & Goodwin, 2009). Scenarios are a purposeful basis for further inquiry of, and
for imaginatively engaging with, the future: they intend to capture and bound the mental mode of decision-makers, highlight pre-
dictability and uncertainty, and reduce the risk of being surprised or unprepared. Scenarios thus aid in changing decision-makers’

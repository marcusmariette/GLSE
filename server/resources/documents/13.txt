Abstract
Atomic Parity Violation (APV) is usually quantified in terms of the weak nuclear charge QW of a nucleus,
which depends on the coupling strength between the atomic electrons and quarks. In this work, we review
the importance of APV to probing new physics using effective field theory. Furthermore, we correlate our
findings with the results from neutrino-nucleus coherent scattering. We revisit signs of parity violation in
polarized electron scattering and show how precise measurements on the Weinberg’s angle give rise to
competitive bounds on light mediators over a wide range of masses and interactions strengths. Our bounds
are firstly derived in the context of simplified setups and then applied to several concrete models, namely
Dark Z, Two Higgs Doublet Model-U (1)X and 3-3-1, considering both light and heavy mediator regimes.

1. Introduction
For decades it was assumed that the laws of nature preserved parity, but the seminal paper
of Lee and Yang in 1956 gave rise to a different perspective [1]. It was indeed confirmed in
1957 in the realm of weak interactions, via the beta decay in Cobalt [2] and muon decay [3]. In
1959 the possibility of observing parity violation in atomic physics and electron scattering was
contemplated [4] and further investigated in the late 70’s [5–7]. Interestingly these ideas preceded
the theory of electroweak interactions. The following decades were populated by experiments
that aimed at probing parity violation [8]. For interesting reviews on APV see [9–14].
Our current understanding of parity and APV has greatly improved. Given the experimental
precision acquired over the years, we may now test new physics models that feature parity-
violating interactions. The main objects of study in this regard are the Weak Charge of the Cesium
(Cs) and polarized electron scattering.
Concerning the first observable, the weak charge of a nucleus, QW , is an analogous of the
electromagnetic charge, where the Z boson is the key player of the atomic electron and nucleus
interactions instead. QW is the sum of the weak charges of all constituents of the atomic nucleus,
QW = (2Z + N )QW (u) + (Z + 2N )QW (d), where QW (u, d) accounts for the Z interactions
with up and down quarks and it depends on sin2 θW , with θW being Weinberg’s angle. To un-
derstand how the Z boson can affect atomic transitions and QW is extracted from experiments,
one needs to perform precise atomic physics calculations and measure the left-right asymmetry
ALR , which is naively estimated to be ALR  α2m2
e/m2
Z ∼ 10−15. Despite atoms with a high
atomic number be, in principle, better suited for experimental observation of APV [15], because
of the enhancement in ALR by orders of magnitude, such high atomic number makes the theoret-
ical determination of ALR extremely challenging. For this reason, Cesium has become a popular
target because it offers a good compromise between high atomic number, necessary to have siz-
able effects, and relatively simple atomic structure, required to make precise atomic calculations.
Precise measurements of APV in Cesium have been presented in [16,17]. Based on them, de-
tailed atomic physic computations yielded the following determination: Qexp
W = −72.62 ± 0.43
[18,19], in slight disagreement with the SM prediction Qth
W = −73.23 ± 0.01 [20,21]. Such pre-
cise measurements of the Cs weak charge can be used to constraint new physics effects.
The other parity violation observable, polarized electron scattering, also constitutes an impor-
tant laboratory to new physics searches. Again, the left-right asymmetry is the key observable.
For deep inelastic scattering processes of the type eL,RN → eX, the left-right asymmetry can be
expressed, in the quark model and in the limit of zero nucleon mass, in the relatively simple form
A/Q2 = a1 + a2f (y).1 The coefficients a1, a2 depend on the axial-vector coupling between the
electron and quarks, which, in turns, depends on sin2 θW , θW being Weinberg’s angle. y and Q
represent, respectively, the fraction of energy transferred from the electron to the hadrons and the
momentum transfer. Detailed expressions for a1, a2 and f can be found, for example, in [8,22].
Measurement of A translates into a measurement of sin2 θW at a given momentum Q. It is well-
known that photon exchange diagrams conserve parity but processes mediated by the Z do not
as it not interact with left-handed and right-handed fermions in the same way. In a similar vein,
eventual additional massive vector bosons from new physics models might also contribute to the
left-right asymmetry. This kind of contribution can be conveniently parametrized as a shift on
1 In the case of electron-positron scattering or the so-called Moeller scattering (scattering on electrons), the Q2 depen-
dence of the asymmetry is more complicated and is parametrized by a form factor.

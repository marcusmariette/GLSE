Fracturing two-dimensional random fiber networks of different densities (porosities) were statistically
analyzed using both high-resolution finite element models and image analysis algorithms. Under small
strains, the finite element fracture models revealed that networks with high relative densities were able
to localize evolving fractures to small cracks while surprisingly larger cracks were required to localize
fractures in networks of lower density. Further, it is indicated that the pore size distribution in fiber net-
works is rather diverse and can be captured using two mixed Gamma distributions; one part describing
the background size distribution containing the vast majority of pores, and a second part describing the
size distribution of larger pores and open regions. The second part covers less than 5% of the total net-
work area but seems to be of paramount importance for the network’s global fracture behavior. It seems
as a fiber network’s crack sensitivity is related to the average pore size in the second part of the mixed
Gamma distribution. The analysis is remarkably consistent with reported experiments.

1. Introduction
Fracture of randomly distributed fiber materials (e.g. paper or
nonwoven fabrics) has been extensively studied during the past
decades (among others Seth and Page, 1974; Niskanen, 1993;
Considine et al., 2011; Mäkelä and Fellers, 2012; Hagman and
Nygårds, 2012; Coffin et al., 2013; Isaksson and Hägglund, 2007;
saksson and Hägglund, 2009; Hägglund and Isaksson, 2006). Other
studies on the topic include Ridruejo et al. (2015) who reported
crack insensitivity in experiments on polypropylene nonwoven
fabrics. Stachewicz et al. (2011) reported crack insensitivity in frac-
ture experiments on electro spun nanofiber networks. Koh et al.
(2013) monitored fracture experiments on polymeric fiber net-
works to analyze the mechanical behavior in the vicinity of crack
tips. While some experimental observations were reported, Koh
et al. (2013) concluded that computer models have to be applied
to reveal relations between microstructural properties and failure
mechanisms in fiber networks. Further, Kulachenko and Uesaka
(2012) used a sophisticated finite element model to analyze defor-
mation and failure behavior of wet networks with dynamic bond-
ing/debonding properties. Goutianos et al. (2018) applied a finite
element model to reveal the mechanical behavior of inter-fiber
bonds in cellulose networks and how they influence a network’s
global tensile strength. Deogekar and Picu (2018) studied fracture
accumulation in fiber network models and reported that global
strength increases linearly with network density and with bond
strength, and that heterogeneity in bond strength retards fracture
localization thus promoting ductility on a global scale. In recent
experimental studies (Krasnoshlyk et al., 2018a, 2018b) it was
reported that the presence of relatively large open regions in a fiber
network heavily influenced the material’s ability to localize frac-
tures to present cracks: a high-density paper was able to localize
fracture to very small cracks while a rather large crack was
required in a low-density paper. Using image analysis,
Krasnoshlyk et al. (2018a) reported that a critical crack size to
obtain fracture localization was about three times larger than the
average size of open regions. Similarly, Chen and Isaksson
(2018a) conducted fracture experiments on brittle open solid
foams and reported that a crack of about 3–4 cells was needed to
obtain localization of evolving fractures, meaning that from a glo-
bal fracture point of view, the foams were insensitive to cracks
smaller than this critical size. In finite element analyses, Chen
and Isaksson (2018b) later confirmed the experimental results.
Carlsson and Isaksson (2020) obtained similar results in highly
resolved numerical phase field fracture models of wood. Thus, from
both experimental and numerical studies it is clear that porous
materials with a larger pore size have a relatively higher crack
insensitivity than porous materials with smaller pores, because
the pores act as naturally existing defects/cracks. Even though both

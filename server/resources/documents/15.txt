Standard Model Effective Field Theory
Meson-antimeson mixing provides the most stringent constraints on baryon- and lepton-number
conserving New Physics, probing scales higher than 105 TeV. In the context of the effective theory of
weak interactions, these constraints translate into severe bounds on the coefficients of F = 2 operators.
Generalizing to the effective theory invariant under the Standard Model gauge group, valid above the
electroweak scale, the bounds from F = 2 processes also affect F = 1 and even F = 0 operators,
due to log-enhanced radiative corrections induced by Yukawa couplings. We systematically analyze the
effect of the renormalization group evolution above the electroweak scale and provide for the first time
the full set of constraints on all relevant dimension-six operators.

The absence of tree-level flavour changing neutral currents
(FCNC) in the Standard Model (SM), and their suppression at the
loop level [1–3], make FCNC processes a very sensitive probe
of New Physics (NP). In particular, meson-antimeson mixing, a
FCNC process with flavour quantum number F changed by two
units (F = 2), provides to date the most stringent constraints on
baryon- and lepton-number conserving NP, reaching an astonishing
NP scale of O(105) TeV for strongly-interacting NP with arbitrary
flavour structure [4–6]. This extraordinary NP sensitivity is due
both to the Glashow-Iliopoulos-Maiani (GIM) mechanism and to
the hierarchical structure of quark masses and mixing angles. In-
deed, the bound on the NP scale can be lowered to a few TeV
by requiring Minimal Flavour Violation (MFV), i.e. the absence of
new sources of flavour violation beyond Yukawa couplings [7,8]. In
the MFV case, the sensitivity becomes comparable to other indi-
rect probes of NP such as electroweak (EW) precision observables
or Higgs signal strengths, see, e.g., the recent works in [9,10].
If NP arises at scales much higher than the EW one, its lead-
ing effects in the EW and flavour sectors can be parameterized in
terms of dimension-six local operators built of SM fields and in-
variant under the SM gauge group. Those operators, together with
the SM, form the so-called Standard Model effective field theory
(SMEFT) [11,12]. Quantum corrections due to SM interactions in-

duce a renormalization group (RG) running of SMEFT operators,
which can generate F = 2 operators starting from F = 1 ones.
One may then wonder if mixing onto F = 2 operators implies
any relevant bound on F = 1 ones, to be eventually compared
with present constraints from F = 1 transitions and/or from
other EW processes. RG effects also modify the Yukawa couplings,
leading to a mismatch between the flavour properties of the SMEFT
at the NP and EW scales. This effect is relevant for non-universal
operators in the SMEFT, since gauge invariance prevents a full
alignment in flavour space of non-universal operators involving
left-handed doublets, leading unavoidably to FCNC contributions
that depend on the flavour structure at the NP scale. In this Letter
we move our first steps towards a deep investigation of the flavour
structure of the SMEFT, focusing on F = 2 transitions, the most
sensitive probes of NP in the flavour sector, and present bounds on
all relevant operators, including all leading RG effects.
Let us begin highlighting the importance of F = 2 processes.
Extending the notation of [8], we define the fundamental FCNC
MFV coupling between generations i and j in the basis of di-
agonal down or up Yukawa couplings as ( λ(d)
FC )i= j ≡ ( Y U Y †
U )i j ∼
Y 2

3i V 3 j or ( λ(u)
FC )i= j ≡ (Y D Y †
D )i j ∼ Y 2
b V 3i V ∗
3 j respectively; i, j =
1, 2, 3 are flavour indices, Yq the Yukawa coupling for quark q in
the diagonal basis and V the CKM matrix. We characterize the typ-
ical SM FCNC scale as 0 ≡ Yt sin2 θW M W /α ∼ 2.3 TeV. An MFV-
type NP model will generate F = 1 and F = 2 operators with
the same chiral structure as the SM contribution, up to corrections

the down sector, those have the same structure of top-mediated
SM contributions, so the most stringent constraints are expected
from top-dominated processes such as meson-antimeson mixing
or b → sγ , leading to lower bounds on the NP scale of few TeV [7,
8]. For a generic model, constraints get much more severe due not
only to the absence of the SM CKM and GIM suppression, but also
to the possible presence of right-handed flavour changing neu-
tral currents, which are both enhanced by RG evolution and by
hadronic matrix elements [14–17]. One expects to constrain the
ratio of the NP coefficients over the NP scale  as follows:

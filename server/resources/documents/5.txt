Blockchain, the technology infrastructure behind the famous cryptocurrency bitcoin, can take away the notion
of trust from centralized organizations to a decentralized platform that is mathematically verifiable and cryp-
tographically secure. It is gaining more significant momentum exponentially and disrupts the way businesses
function beyond the digital currency aspects. This work presents a text mining literature analysis of research
articles published in major digital libraries on blockchain technology and cybersecurity. This literature analysis
employs automated text mining approaches such as topic modeling and keyphrase extraction for unearthing the
themes from a vast body of literature. This analysis highlights the multidisciplinary nature of blockchain tech-
nology within the cybersecurity domain. The findings also show the cyber threats and vulnerabilities that evolve
with blockchain technology developments. This analysis also showcases the computer security research commu-
nity’s vulnerabilities and provides future research dimensions that are crucial for designing secure blockchain
applications and platforms.
1. Introduction
Blockchain was initially introduced with the concept of cryptocur-
rencies Tandon, Revankar, Palivela, & Parihar (2021), especially Bitcoin
Nakamoto (2009). However, this back-end transaction recording tech-
nology has great potential in taking out the notion of trust from the cen-
tral third parties to the cryptographically verifiable platform. The idea
of decentralization of doing businesses has grown leaps and bounds and
has already found its scope in supply chains Ahsan & Siddique (2022);
Deepu & Ravi (2021), health-care Hussien, Yasin, Udzir, Zaidan, &
Zaidan (2019); Yaqoob, Salah, Jayaraman, & Al-Hammadi (2021), mar-
keting Jain, Dash, Kumar, & Luthra (2021) & finance Grover, Kar,
Janssen, & Ilavarasan (2019b),food Yadav, Misra, & Goundar (2020) &
agriculture marketing Yadav, Misra, & Goundar (0000), banking, in-
surance, sports Yadav, Misra, Rana, & Singh (2021a); Yadav, Misra,
Rana, Singh, & Goundar (2021b), cyber-security Azmoodeh, Dehghan-

Chaturvedi, Chansarkar, & Gupta (2021), and many more Grover, Kar,
& Janssen (2019a); Upadhyay (2020). The well defined and established
cryptographical Luntovskyy & Guetter (2018) and mathematical tech-
niques like hashing Alkandari, Al-Shaikhli, & Alahmad (2013) make
the ever-growing ledger of blockchain tamper-proof, secure and im-
mutable Yaga, Mell, Roby, & Scarfone (2018). However, they have cer-
tain limitations Ali Syed et al. (2019); Lee, Yang, Onik, & Kim (2019).
Blockchain also uses consensus algorithms for verifying and joining the

blocks to it. For instance, the Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus algo-
rithm Gemeliarana & Sari (2018); Gupta & Mahajan (2020), the ma-
jor public blockchain networks such as bitcoin and Ethereum uses was
prone to vulnerabilities Kaushal, Bagga, & Sobti (2017) such as 51%
attack Apostolaki, Zohar, & Vanbever (2017). Such threats and flaws
boosted the scope of the research in the security domain of blockchain
technology. Later evolved Blockchain 2.0, which focuses on the idea
of smart contracts was initially coined by Nike Szabo Szabo (1997).
Smart contracts Ferreira (2021) or law of code Filippi & Hassan (2018),
has the potential to eliminate the requirements of any trusted third
party. Ethereum Buterin (2013) and the Hyperledger Fabric, with the
chain code Dinh et al. (2018), came to be a few of the widely ac-
cepted blockchains with smart contracts. Unlike the bitcoin blockchain
where the total number of bitcoins is limited to 21 million, Ethereum
has no such limit. However, Ethereum also uses the PoW consensus al-
gorithm. After analyzing a significant number of blockchain literature,
it is evident that smart contracts can have prominent use in the fields
beyond finance Ferreira da Silva & Moro (2021); Stallone, Wetzels, &
Klaas (2021), yet there is a wide scope of improvement with respect
to the cyber security Gehem, Usanov, Frinking, & Rademaker (2015);
Kim, Jeong, Kim, & So (2011); Li & Liu (2021).
The systematic literature analysis on the body of knowledge re-
lated to blockchain technology using topic modeling highlights the
trends and gaps and suggests prominent future trends are invaluable.
Topic models are a suite of text understanding algorithms that un-

earth the latent patterns from large bodies of unstructured text docu-
ments. This method is widely used in several applications Jadil, Rana,
& Dwivedi (2022); Jutla, Bodorik, & Zhang (2006); Wandabwa, Naeem,
Mirza, & Pears (2021). The natural language processing Nair, Agrawal,
Domnic, & Kumar (2021); R, Kuanr, & KR (2021) based approach
has itself spread over several fields like journalism Ma, Nadamoto,
& Tanaka (2006) etc. and for different application including business
Verma, Sharma, Deb, & Maitra (2021), IoT Herath & Mittal (2022).
There are several topic modeling algorithms available Gallinucci, Gol-
farelli, & Rizzi (2015); Kinoshita, Takasu, & Adachi (2015), those dif-
fer in the way they make assumptions to generate hidden word col-
lections called ”topics”. A paper by Vayansky et. al. Vayansky & Ku-
mar (2020) presents a more detailed review of the topic modeling. La-
tent Semantic Analysis (LSA), Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI), Proba-
bilistic Latent Semantic Indexing (pLSI), etc., were the topic modeling al-
gorithms introduced early in the natural language processing literature.
A mixed model of top-down and bottom-up approaches was presented
by Catarina et al. Ferreira da Silva & Moro (2021) to analyze the applica-
tion of blockchain technology for consumer trust. Jiang et al. Jiang, Xie,
& Fan (2021) analyzed 282 articles in their study to present the research
trends focused on the business & management in blockchain networks.
In another related study on the review of blockchain cyber security
Taylor, Dargahi, Dehghantanha, Parizi, & Choo (2020), the blockchain-
based security applications are analyzed, showing the increase in the
adoption of blockchain networks in various domains. Taylor et al. have
also discussed the security of blockchain in IoT and AI data security
in their article Taylor et al. (2020). Blockchain technologies have been
considered an effective solution for shared data protection and provid-
ing data trust as a service as suggested by Richard et. al. Lomotey, Kumi,
& Deters (2022).
By adopting text mining, it is possible to cover a vast body of
knowledge that otherwise would render infeasible only at the expense
of computational power Feng, Chiam, & Lo (2017); Moro, Cortez, &
Rita (2015); Skute (2019). In contrast, we focus on studies that highlight
the cyber threats and vulnerabilities, and their mitigation in blockchain
technology. We adopt an existing top-down and a bottom-up procedure
based on the blockchain taxonomies to draw the list of keywords from
each of the gathered 833 articles, published until April 2022. This ap-
proach enriches existing blockchain taxonomies by benefiting from a
passive crowd-sourcing effect. The authors defined the articles’ key-
words and considered them essential for indexing purposes. The arti-
cles are then automatically analyzed using text mining and topic mod-
eling to unveil interesting topics that summarize the existing body of
knowledge. The use of text mining to conduct literature analyses is be-
coming mainstream as science keeps developing grounded on Internet
media Feng et al. (2017); Skute (2019). Through such an approach, we
aim to contribute to a better understanding of BC from the critical con-
sumer trust perspective. We raise the research questions (RQ) as given
in Table 1.
The remainder of this article is organized as follows: We discuss the
inception and evolution of blockchain technology, the prominence of
blockchain in cybersecurity, and discuss topic modeling with reference
to one of the most widely used algorithms called Latent Dirichlet Allo-
cation (LDA) in Section 2. Section 3 presents the materials and methods
adopted in this analysis, and Section 4 presents the results and the de-
liberations. The applications and limitations of the proposed approach
are discussed in Section 5, and the future research trends are outlined
in Section 6. In Section 7, the authors conclude the findings, and some
perspectives are also presented.
2. Cybersecurity and the prominence of blockchain technology
Improving security measures, building a safe environment over the
internet, and ensuring the quick availability of information at the same
time seems to be an ever-lasting challenge. Unfortunately, even after
this many technical advancements, many of the previous research works
show that the overall blockchain network is still prone to cyber-attacks
Chen et al. (2022); Christen, Schnell, Ranbaduge, & Vidanage (2022);
Wang, Wang, Cao, Li, & Xiong (2019). Vulnerable consensus mecha-
nisms are one of the reasons for some security threats, which ultimately
can affect the entire blockchain network. As per the data collected from
the CVEs cve (1999) database, we found that some of the most com-
mon vulnerabilities on blockchain networks are (a) 51% or Majority At-
tack (in PoW-based blockchains like Bitcoin), (b) Routine attack (double
coin spent), (c) BC Endpoint Vulnerabilities, (d) Attacks due to vulnera-
bility in smart-contracts and their deployment, (e) Transaction Privacy
Leakage, and, (f) Phishing Attacks. As per the official portal of CVEs
cve (1999), the DoS (denial of service) was the very first cyber attack
launched on the Bitcoin blockchain in 2010.
Till now, over sixty easy and hard level vulnerabilities have been re-
ported just for bitcoin and related blockchain networks in the last few
years. Due to having a reward mechanism in PoW, the vulnerable proof-
of-work consensus algorithm is responsible for most of these attacks.
However, along with the high threat of 51% attack, bitcoin was also
found to be vulnerable to some other cyber-attacks, including denial-of-
service Baek et al. (2019) and bypassing the authentication Singh, Ho-
sen, & Yoon (2021), in many cases. Ethereum overcame many of these
security issues, but it was found to be vulnerable. Decentralized Au-
tonomous Organization (DAO) Zhao, Chen, Chen, Wang, & Tang (2017),
the largest crowdfunded project on Ethereum blockchain, was one of the
well-known applications of blockchain during 2016. However, later, the
attack on DAO further led the Ethereum blockchain to split into two
branches forming the Ethereum & Ethereum Classic. Several smart con-
tracts were also vulnerable, and such incidents have kept on occurring.
It brought in new ideas leading to a rapid improvement in the secu-
rity side of blockchain. Many improvements were suggested in the tra-
ditional PoW consensus algorithm by developing new alternative con-
sensus mechanisms Masseport, Darties, Giroudeau, & Lartigau (2020);
Xue et al. (2018). One such method is Proof-of-Stack (PoS) Nair & Do-
rai (2021) that does not require mining and hence reduces the environ-
mental loss as in PoW. We went through some previous research works
that came up with strengthening these blockchains and focusing on the
security aspects of the same Kushwaha, Joshi, Singh, Kaur, & Lee (2022);
Nam & Kil (2022); Sayeed, Marco-Gisbert, & Caira (2020).
To ensure the proper security of the existing and the upcoming
blockchains, early detection and mitigation of possible cyber attacks is
a good idea. Due to being closely related to the previous attack vectors,
some specific sub-part of the blockchains could be highly vulnerable
to the different attacks. So, we considered some interesting articles re-
lated to the topic modeling for blockchain and its applications. One such
work related to the topic modeling by Catarina et al. Ferreira da Silva &
Moro (2021) presents an intelligent approach for not only understand-
ing the work but also opens the doors for even more research areas based
on the similar areas of the applications George & Birla (2018). The topic

Despite its benefits and promising future, security and privacy challenges for the IoT wireless communication of
edge computing environment remain unaddressed. As a result, proper authentication mechanisms are critical, es-
pecially in the extreme scenario where some edge facilities are not functional. For the above consideration, in this
paper we develop an efficient IoT group association and updating mechanism in edge computing paradigm. The
proposed scheme can provide data transmission and communication guarantees for special practical scenarios.
The group key updating process in our architecture only necessitates minor changes on the EI side, whereas the
decryption information of some IoT devices remains constant if the devices have not been revoked. The proposed
strategy can accomplish the desired security features, according to the security analysis.
1. Introduction
Because of the inherent open wireless communication features [1–
3], IoT data sharing is vulnerable to a variety of security and privacy
problems, particularly in IoT group communication environments with
a large number of participating devices. Advanced security measures
and privacy preservation mechanisms are critical for edge infrastruc-
ture in this circumstances [4,5]. Effective and efficient authentication
mechanism between IoT terminal users (TUs) and the regarding edge
infrastructure (EI) could provide preliminary protection for IoT data ex-
change. As a result, various known and unknown secure threats such
as eavesdropping, impersonation, and the malicious replaying opera-
tions conducted by adversaries can be prevented, which is important for
the current booming 5G industry and the future of 6G communications.
Nowadays, because of the proliferation of edge computing techniques,
the large storing and instant data processing requirements of IoT net-
work can be satisfied with the cloud and edge infrastructure.
Meanwhile, the edge computing infrastructure is recognized as a de-
centralized computing architecture that shifts applications, correspond-
ing data, and service processing from the network’s central nodes to the
network’s logical terminal devices. Edge computing is capable of divid-
ing large services that would otherwise be processed and managed to-
tally by the central server or node into much smaller, more manageable
chunks. In the next, it will distribute them to the edge devices for pro-
cessing. As a matter of fact, the edge nodes are the local servers that are
closer to the user-end devices, which can reduce latency and speed up
data processing and delivery. Edge computing reduces latency, increases
efficiency, and improves security and privacy protection by bringing in-

telligent analytical processing services closer to the data source. For ex-
ample, in 2014, more than 30 percent of smart meters from Spain’s three
largest electricity service providers were found to have severe security
vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers. Therefore, the at-
tackers are able to commit electricity fraud or even manage the entire
circuit systems. Security attacks have been even more damaging in the
industrial IoT space, with the 2018 TSMC manufacturing site attack, the
2017 ransomware incident, and the 2015 Ukraine massive power out-
age all causing significant damage to targeted industrial IoT systems and
individual devices.
As for the various types of applications and implementations in the
scope of Internet of Things (IoT), the participating IoT devices will
record/generate/transmit a large amount of data involving user privacy.
Therefore, data security risks are becoming more serious. More than a
million families and children’s data, conversation recording data, and
action track data have been leaked since 2015. Hundreds of thousands
of users’ credit card accounts, biometric data, and other personal infor-
mation were stolen when a vending machine company in the United
States was hacked in July 2017. Additionaly, a Chinese security firm
that makes IoT cameras warns that hackers can use the commonly used
default credentials to directly access the user devices and even acquire
the sensitive cameras’ live data, which leads to significant security dan-
ger to every customer.
Wireless IoT communication, as an important data transmission
channel of IoT, has very limited energy, processing capacity, storage
capacity and communication capacity. The overall security reliability
of IoT is harmed by the fact that a large number of traditional devices
lack synchronous configuration protection. Meanwhile, the convergence

and diversification of IoT terminals and applications have increased the
security risk associated with the IoT industry. Attackers have a large and
extensive entry point for network attacks thanks to the growing variety
of IoT interconnected devices, which has resulted in a slew of problems
and challenges for IoT. In this case, edge computing technologies can
be used to significantly improve the security level of IoT systems based
on this, allowing users’ private data to be protected during both the
interaction and storage processes.
Many research accomplishments have been accomplished recently,
focusing on the IoT safe authentication issue using edge comput-
ing, which employs a variety of cryptographic design and verification
methodologies. It’s worth noting that in some cases, the key generation
center (KGC) arranges all of the keying information for specific IoT de-
vices, potentially causing the key escrow problem. Therefore, it is crit-
ical for the IoT device to construct its own partial secret pair and then
retain the key information hidden from all other entities, even the key
generation center. By adopting the unique partial confidential secrets
from both the KGC and the device itself, certificateless encryption out-
performs other approaches in this regard. It’s worth noting that neither
the KGC nor the IoT device has access to the other party’s partial secret.
We assume the particular IoT data sharing scenario intended for ex-
treme environments, where the edge facilities may be disabled or com-
promised [6–8]. In fact, in most isolated natural landscapes, such as
mountains, desert areas or tropical rain forests, especially in sparsely
populated areas, it’s possible that the edge infrastructures are not al-
ways available. That is, most of the IoT devices of this region that origi-
nally rely on the wireless communication for data sharing may be out of
touch. In this case, we utilizes the nearby other IoT devices that are still
in contact with the edge infrastructure to conduct the message forward-
ing service. In this case, even in out-of-service region, the IoT devices
can still maintain instant data sharing with the remote cloud server.
Meanwhile, all the nearby IoT devices are capable of constructing the
randomized data forwarding and delivering networks if necessary.
2. Related work
Nowadays, the topics of data security and user privacy protection to-
wards IoT environments are extensively investigated. Numerous studies
regarding authenticated key management and reliable vehicular data
exchange of different IoT sceanrios have been conducted so far. As for
the vehicular communication, in 2012, Lu et al. [9] developed a dy-
namic key updating protocol DIKE to satisfy the privacy-preserving and
reliability requirements of location-based VANET services (LBS). The
distributed session keys are cooperatively updated by the involved de-
vices whenever the revocation process initializes. In [10], the validating
process towards certificate revocation lists (CRLs) in terms of vehicu-
lar message authentication is improved with the adopted hash chains.
Subsequently, a scalable group key management scheme with message
encryption is proposed by Aliev et al. [11]. Notably, the matrix-based
encryption algorithm is utilized in the distributed architecture so that
enhanced security characteristics and efficiency can be guaranteed. Sim-
ilarly, Aman et al. [12] developed a robust IoV authentication scheme
with unclonable functions. The approaching devices are verified by the
gateway instead of each RSU. In 2021, Cai et al. [13] proposed a con-
ditional privacy protection mechanism adopting ring signcryption and
identity-based cryptosystem. Identities of the misbehaving nodes can be
revealed with the assigned tracking marks. Recently, several authenti-
cated key management (AKM) schemes are developed [14–16].
Specifically, identity-based and attributed-based cryptographic tech-
niques have been widely adopted in the authenticated key management
process. A cooperative message authentication and key management
framework is developed in 2011 [17], where decentralized message
verification tasks are allocated to each legitimate device. Meanwhile,
with the aim to enhance the communication efficiency of emergency
services, Yeh et al. [18] proposed an attributed-based access control
scheme ABACS so that data confidentiality property is provided. Af-
terward, the pseudonymous authentication-based conditional privacy
protocol PACP [19] is presented by Huang et al.. The improvement in
terms of computation and storage cost during the message validation
process is achieved. Thereafter, two privacy-preserving authentication
mechanisms [20,21] for secure vehicular communication are respec-
tively proposed in 2014. Subsequently, He et al. developed an identity-
based VANET authentication method without pairing [22]. Accordingly,
the computational complexity of the verification session can be signif-
icantly reduced. In 2020, Feng et al. applied the blockchain-assisted
authentication framework in [23] for privacy preservation. Dynamic
revocation and conditional tracking towards the misbehaving devices
are enabled. Another attribute-based encryption (ABE) model [24] is
developed in order to meet the responding time requirement of edge
intelligence-empowered IoV. The proposed ABEM-POD adopts the par-
allel outsourced decryption process, which is of specific usage for the
tree access structure. Another attribute-based verification scheme for
secure data sharing is proposed in [25].
3. Preliminaries
In this part, the fundamental principles and preliminary knowledge
are given so as to facilitate the reader’s understandings.
3.1. Lagrange polynomial interpolation
Definition 1 (Degree of Polynomial over. 𝔽𝑝) Let 𝔽𝑝 be a finite field,
𝑃 (𝑥) =
𝑡∑
𝑖=0
𝜖𝑖𝑥𝑖 be a non-zero polynomial, where 𝜖𝑡 ≠ 0, the arbitrary pos-
itive integer 𝑡 is defined as the degree of 𝑃 (𝑥) such that deg 𝑃 (𝑥) = 𝑡.
Accordingly, define {(𝑥0, 𝑦0), ... , (𝑥𝑗 , 𝑦𝑗 ), ... , (𝑥𝑘, 𝑦𝑘)} as a set of 𝑘 + 1
distinctive data points such that ∀𝑚 ≠ 𝑗, 𝑥𝑚 ≠ 𝑥𝑗 . The polynomial 𝑄𝑘(𝑥)
of the degree 𝑘 over the finite field 𝔽𝑝 is built according to
𝑄𝑘(𝑥) =
𝑘∑
𝑖=0
𝑎𝑖𝑥𝑖,
where 𝑄𝑘(𝑥𝑖) = 𝑦𝑖 for all 𝑖 = 0, ... , 𝑘. The unique Lagrange basis polyno-
mials 𝓁𝑗 (𝑥) (0 ≤ 𝑗 ≤ 𝑘) of degree at most 𝑘 are computed as
𝓁𝑗 (𝑥) = (𝑥−𝑥0 )
(𝑥𝑗 −𝑥0 ) ... (𝑥−𝑥𝑗−1 )
(𝑥𝑗 −𝑥𝑗−1)
(𝑥−𝑥𝑗+1 )
(𝑥𝑗 −𝑥𝑗+1 ) ... (𝑥−𝑥𝑘 )
(𝑥𝑗 −𝑥𝑘)
= ∏𝑘
𝑚=0,𝑚≠𝑗
𝑥−𝑥𝑚
𝑥𝑗 −𝑥𝑚
.
The corresponding interpolation polynomial 𝐿𝑘(𝑥) in the Lagrange form
can be defined as 𝐿𝑘(𝑥) = ∑𝑘
𝑗=0 𝑦𝑗 𝓁𝑗 (𝑥). That is,
𝐿𝑘(𝑥) =
𝑘∑
𝑗=0
( 𝑘∏
𝑚=0,𝑚≠𝑗
𝑥 − 𝑥𝑚
𝑥𝑗 − 𝑥𝑚
)
𝑦𝑗 .
Accordingly, for ∀𝑖 ≠ 𝑗,
𝓁𝑗 (𝑥𝑖) =
𝑘∏
𝑚=0,𝑚≠𝑗
𝑥𝑖 − 𝑥𝑚
𝑥𝑗 − 𝑥𝑚
= 0,
and
𝓁𝑗 (𝑥𝑗 ) =
𝑘∏
𝑚=0,𝑚≠𝑗
𝑥𝑗 − 𝑥𝑚
𝑥𝑗 − 𝑥𝑚
= 1
hold. Hence, the reconstruction of the polynomial 𝑄𝑘(𝑥) can be per-
formed with 𝑘 + 1 distinctive data points on the graph of polynomial
𝑄𝑘(𝑥) and 𝐿𝑘(𝑥).
3.2. Bilinear pairing
Let 𝔾1 and 𝔾2 be the cyclic additive group and multiplicative group
generated with prime order 𝑞. The mapping ̂ 𝑒 ∶ 𝔾1 × 𝔾1 → 𝔾2 is defined
as a bilinear pairing with the following characteristics:
